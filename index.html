          Part 1: Parallel Categories Plot</h2>
          
          <p style="text-indent: 20px; width : 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 25%">
            The following visualization shows categories of voting frequency in relation to the voter's education and income level. The connected nature of the plot also allows any two categories to be comparatively analyzed, such as education and income.

            It is interesting to note that between the three various voting categories, all levels of income and education are represented within each category. This is an important distinction to make, as it shows that falling into a level of education or income bracket is never an absolute in determining the associated voter categories. There were interesting trends however, despite the range of representation.

            Among voters who always voted, they were most represented in the college education level with 824 people. There was more representation in the college level of education by sporadic voters, and this ribbon had 1073 respondents. Voters who rarely or never voted appeared most often in the high school or less bracket for education. Representation among each voter category to education levels was more varied than it is between voter category and income. While there is still variation within each income level, the voter category distribution is more evenly split into thirds. For each category of income brackets, there was the most representation in the sporadic category, which comes from sporadic voters having the most representation within the dataset. Of voters who always vote and sporadically vote, there were most represented in the $75-$125k level of income with 573 people and 728 respectively. Sporadic voters had an even representation in $125k and above and $40-75k levels of income. Voters who rarely or never vote were most often in the less than $40k level of income with 537 voters, and the remainder of rare voters were evenly distributed among the remaining categories.

            Comparing income and education categories independently from voter frequency provided interesting conclusions. The highest level of income, $125k or more, is most related to a college level of education. An education of high school or less was most represented to an income level of less than $40k followed by the next highest bracket which marks an income of $40-75k. Some college education had a fairly even distribution among income brackets, without a particular level of income standing out as noticeably different.

          Part 2: Bubble Plot</h1>

          <p style="text-indent: 20px; width : 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 25%">
            This bubble plot shows the percentage of voter turnout, percentage of absentee votes, active registered voters, and region of each locality by year. It is interesting to note that percentage of voter turnout can be greater than 100%, as the actual turnout was compared to the active registered voters, which is a subset of total registered voters.

            2020 looks particularly different from the other years. The differences in this year include greater numbers of total registered voters which is shown through the size dimension. Additionally, there was less variation in the percentage of voter turnout among counties. In other years, especially 2018, there was a wide discrepancy, and thus counties appeared spread out along the x axis. In 2020, the x axis is narrowly concentrated between 60 to 90 percent of voter turnout. The most noticeable difference is the drastically high percentage of absentee voting. One county did not have any absentee votes, while others had a percentage in the mid 80's. This is demonstrated by an elongated distribution along the y axis. Overall, this year shows data points that are distributed in a long, narrow area. The majorly different percentage of absentee voting makes sense, as 2020 is when the covid-19 pandemic began.

            It would not be easier for viewers to determine that this year was different through individual plots. Animation in this case shows the points flowing around, and viewers can see the fast jump which occurred in 2020. So long as the yearly animation has the same bounds along the x and y axis, then the dynamic nature emphasizes the difference rather than masking it. The distribution of region is a little difficult to compare across years. There appears to be a diverse representation throughout each year, so separate plots may not reveal drastically different conclusions. The main benefit of separate plots would be to make it easier to see the regions that tend to have high total registered voter counts across the years. This, however, loses the dynamic jump which emphasizes 2020. If that is the goal of the visualization, then leaving the animation is a better approach. Similarly, comparing years that appear more similar, may be more easily seen in static plots, but for this data, animation is a fun and effective addition to demonstrate a drastically different year.

            The years where Presidential elections occurred alongside Congressional elections had slightly noticeable differences in overall voter turnout compared to other years. In these years, the voting turnout tended to be 50 to 90 percent while in non-presidential years, especially 2014 and 2022, the voter turnout ranged from 30 to 70 percent. The non-presidential year of 2018 was an exception to these trends as it had a wide distribution of voter turnouts ranging from about 40 percent to 190 percent. The northern region tended to have proportionately high counts for total registered voters, but this was consistent across presidential and non-presidential election years. During non-presidential election years, total voter turnout across all regions tended to be lower compared to presidential election years.

            Based on Virginia's voting data, the percentage of voter turnout was lowest in the southwest, with turnout ranging from about 30 percent, to the mid 40's. Furthermore, the low turnout trend continued along the southern boarder of the state as well, although it did not get as low as the southwest area. Voter turnout in 2022 tended to be greatest in the north, and down the center of the state. These areas are some of the most populated consisting of highly trafficked northern Virginia cities as well as the Richmond area. Most of the cities had lower level of voter turnout compared to the surrounding county they are enclosed in.
